# Payslip Analysis Automation Tool

This tool automates the extraction and analysis of payslip data, making it easier to calculate what an employee is owed in terms of annual pay, sick leave, and other benefits. Originally built to help my dad, who worked for a company for 10+ years and needed to audit his pay records after being let go, this script processes multiple PDF payslips and summarizes key financial details.

## Features:
- Extracts data such as Gross Pay, Net Pay, Pay Item, Quantity, Rate, Taxable Amount, and more from PDF payslips.
- Exports the analyzed data into a CSV file for easy review.
- Supports batch processing of multiple PDF payslips.

## Usage:
Perfect for employees or consultants who need a clear overview of their pay history, especially after a job termination, to ensure they’ve been paid correctly.

## How to Run:
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Save the PDF payslips to be analyzed into the designated folders.
3. Run the `.py` script using the command prompt:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

This tool is perfect for employees or consultants needing a clear overview of their pay history to verify they’ve been paid correctly, especially in the event of job termination.
